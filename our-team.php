                                <p>Alex is a mechanical engineering junior specializing in design and management. As President of the organisation, he oversees its direction and ensures it serves it purpose. He has been competing in robotics competitions ever since middle school and has a plethora of skills to teach to and mentor new roboticists and enthusiasts. These experiences have led to his form belief that projects are the best way for engineers to learn and test their skills, not only in isolation, but in conjunction with other disciplines. With that in mind he hopes to give the students of UNT the opportunity to learn engineering the proper way.</p>
